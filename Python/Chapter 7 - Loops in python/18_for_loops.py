# Loops are used to do repetitive tasks in an easy way

# for i in range(1, 6):
#     print(i)

# for loop in string
# s = "shadab"
# for i in s:
#     print(i)
    
# for loop in list

l = [1, "shadab", 22, 12.3, True, [22, 19]]
# for i in l:
#     print(i)


# For loop with else
for item in l:
    print(item)

else: # else block is executed when for loop is completed/exhausted
    print("done")
